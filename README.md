Goal
The goal is to create a system that facilitates real-time lookup and understanding of art history terms. This system will be accessible through a Telegram bot and a browser plugin, providing users with:
- Definitions
- Categorization
- Related images and links
- Cross-references to other terms

Core Features
1. Quick Term Lookup: Users can search for terms via Telegram bot or browser plugin.
2. Categorization and Cross-Referencing**: Terms are organized by categories and linked to related concepts.
3. Analytics Dashboard: A web-based interface to track term usage and improve the lexicon.
4. Ease of Contribution: Support for adding new terms directly through Google Sheets integration.


   Target Users
1. Students: Need a quick reference during lectures or while studying.
2. Teachers/Professors: Provide accurate definitions to students during classes.
3. Researchers: Reference terms while conducting detailed analyses.

    Project Roadmap

  Milestone 2: Domain Modeling
- Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to model the problem.
- Identify core entities, services, and relationships.

  Milestone 3: First MVP
